.Sh NAME
.Nm winacl
.Nd recursively set ACL information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aslpvx
.Op Fl a Ar clone | reset
.Op Fl s Ar file
.Op Fl p Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility recursivvely sets NFSv4 discretionary access control information on
the specified path. An action (reset or clone) must be speciifed via -a
and a path via -p.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar clone reset
Perform the specified ACL related operation. There are two options.
.Ar clone,
copy the ACL from the specificied source path and recursively
set the ACL on the target path. If no source path is specified, then the
ACL is copied from the root of the target path.
.Ar reset,
apply a default ACL recursively to the specified path. Default ACL
is
.Dq Li owner@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
.Dq Li group@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
.Dq Li everyone@:rxaRc:fd:allow
.It Fl l
If the target of the operation is a symbolic link, perform the operation
on the symbolic link itself, rather than following the link.
.It Fl s
Source file for ACL operations when using the .Ar clone action. When cloning
the ACL from the source file is recursively set on the target path. If no
source is specified for the clone action, then the ACL is taken from the
file specified by -p.
.It Fl p
Target file for ACL operations when using the .Ar clone and .Ar reset actions.
By default winacl follows symlinks.
.It Fl v
Print paths of targets of ACL operation as new ACL is applied.
.It Fl x
Traverse device / filesystem  boundaries.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl winacl -a reset -v -p /zroot/samba
.Dl winacl -a clone -s /zroot/samba/share1 -p /zroot/samba/share2
.Dl winacl -a clone -p /zroot/samba/share2
