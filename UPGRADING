The following behavioral changes should be noted for anyone upgrading from
earlier builds of FreeNAS (any version) to 9.3-RELEASE

1. This build now uses ZFS, the GRUB boot loader, and GPT partition labels for
all boot media.  This is a significant change from earlier releases and may
cause interoperability issues with older hardware / BIOSes.  In the event of a
failed upgrade, one possible remedy may be to back up your config database and
try a fresh install using the 9.3-RELEASE ISO installation image (which can
also be used from USB devices).

2. Authenticating via LDAP now requires that the connection to the LDAP server
be SSL/TLS.  This prevents account passwords from being sent in clear-text but
may be an unexpected change in behavior for users upgrading from older releases
of FreeNAS.

3. The CTL LUN serial number generator has been changed to match the previous
istgt (userland iSCSI) behavior for compatibility.  This was done after the
9.3-BETA, so those who switched to the Experimental iSCSI target in 9.2.1.x
or used iSCSI in 9.3-BETA will see a serial number change.
